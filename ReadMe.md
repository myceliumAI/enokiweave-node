# Enokiweave

Enokiweave is a block-lattice cryptocurrency designed for sub-second transactions with zero fees. Built to deliver value transfer without compromising on speed or cost.

## Key Features

- **Zero Fees**: All transactions are completely free
- **Sub-second Finality**: Transactions confirm in milliseconds
- **Block-lattice Architecture**: Individual account chains enable parallel processing and swift finality
- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Efficient consensus mechanism keeps network operation lean and sustainable

## How It Works

Enokiweave uses a block-lattice structure where each account operates its own blockchain. This allows for:

- Immediate transaction processing without global consensus bottlenecks
- Parallel validation of transactions across different account chains
- No mining or transaction fees
- Ultra-low latency finalization
